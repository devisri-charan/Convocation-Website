                    Five years at IIIT-Delhi was a great experience in all aspects. It was full of challenging tasks,
                    teaching assistant responsibilities, other curricular activities, and ups and downs. In addition,
                    tours, sports, gym, yoga, and walking around campus with friends and supervisors enriched my
                    experience.

                    The first year passed in finding supervisors and coursework. Picking up supervisors was the most
                    challenging task for me, but eventually, at the end of the first year, I got my first supervisor.
                    Finally, I signed with three supervisors during my Ph.D. journey. Beyond these, I started sports
                    activities and tours with friends; I played table tennis for the first time in my life, and it
                    became my favorite game.

                    I had a wonderful time at IIIT-Delhi. The journey was an absolute thrill ride. I had many amazing
                    experiences, met incredible people, and made lifelong friends. Transitioning from a Wet Lab
                    (Biotechnology) to a Dry Lab (Computational Biology) was difficult. Still, with perseverance and a
                    never-say-die attitude, I completed my Ph.D., which would not have been possible without the help of
                    my friends, family, and many people at IIIT-Delhi. I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Mr.
                    Khushpinder Sharma and Dr. Amita Puri for their unwavering support, bringing me out of my
                    depression, dealing with my panic attacks, and patiently listening to me. They both made my journey
                    much easier and helped me regain my confidence. In the last five and a half years, I've evolved into
                    a confident unwavering optimist who believes there is no such thing as failure, only feedback. I am
                    looking forward to convocation day after years of hard work. I'd like to thank the entire IIIT-Delhi
                    family for their contributions and support over the years.

                    “What next?” was a terrifying question for me after graduating high school. It was time for me to
                    choose my career path and make a crucial life decision. While exploring courses to pursue my
                    undergrad, I came across the BTech in Computer Science and Social Science program offered at
                    IIIT-Delhi. Sure I had my inhibitions and fears, it wasn't a well-established program back then, and
                    there were no alumni to discuss the curriculum or career paths with. Despite all of this, the moment
                    I read about this course, I knew it was what I wanted to pursue!

                    I took the onus to make the best of this amazing opportunity and enrolled in the program. Looking
                    back, it was a risk I took, but it bore great results, and I am glad I took the leap of faith.

                    My four years at IIIT-Delhi were transformational in more than one way. Academically, I tried out a
                    variety of courses, took up research projects in different domains, worked under the guidance of
                    some exemplary professors, and was lucky to secure some amazing scholarships and internships. But
                    more importantly, I grew as a person. College life is where you are encouraged to make decisions,
                    make mistakes and learn from them. It is a time to explore not only your career goals but also
                    yourself! And that is something that I am always going to be grateful for.

                    The extracurricular activities in college made me a better leader. They taught me how to communicate
                    and manage my time better, think on my feet, make decisions on the go, and, most importantly, be
                    confident. I feel each of these skills is as important, if not more, than the knowledge I gained
                    from my courses and projects.

                    However, the one thing that I am most grateful to IIIT-Delhi for is the people I've met here. I made
                    bonds for a lifetime, be it my professors whom I still approach for advice or my friends who,
                    throughout the four years of my college life, pushed me to do better, appreciated me for my
                    achievements, and supported me in my low days.

                    Thank you, IIITD, for all the memories; you will always be fondly remembered.

                    My sincere thanks to my academic supervisors, faculty, staff, and students who helped me succeed in
                    the doctoral program's academic rigor. I joined the Ph.D. program at 39 as a sponsored candidate.
                    When I was in the classroom with 20-year-olds, I did raise the average age a bit. As a graduate
                    student, I never found the age gap challenging. My professors never treated me as anything but
                    another student, and the other students were also great to me. The toughest part for me was the
                    transition from a demanding corporate environment to a rigorous academic environment. I approached
                    the Ph.D. program as a learning process to challenge myself intellectually and emotionally. I have
                    pleasant memories garnered throughout my Ph.D. journey that will be cherished for the rest of my
                    life.

                    4 years at IIIT-Delhi!!! On one thought, it seems like a vast time, while on the other, it seems to
                    have passed very quickly.
                    From the first to the last day of college, I've had many experiences that have changed me in various
                    ways and molded me into my current version. One thing I'm grateful to the Institute is the world of
                    technology, knowledge, and opportunities it opened for me, which in turn gave me the confidence to
                    spread my wings and explore this beautiful world!

                    There are a whole lot of things that a person experiences during this phase of their life. Meeting
                    new people and being in a new environment gives you a different kind of exposure which helps you
                    learn about life. At times, it becomes overwhelming to be in such a competitive environment where
                    everyone is working so hard. Still, it's essential not to get bothered about all this and to believe
                    in yourself and focus on what matters to you. Everyone is unique in their way. Apart from academics,
                    it is also important to explore different things. Not just the academic and external side of yours,
                    but one may also learn how to manage themselves internally. And this is an essential life skill that
                    may also help you to go through not-so-great phases of life.

                    I would like to thank the committee that decided to relax the bachelor's degree (course) criteria
                    for admission to M.Tech. CSE. From scrambling to finding the institutes considering electrical
                    background as well for a Master's in CSE to securing a Gold medal for excellent academic
                    performance, IIIT-Delhi accepted me with open arms and transformed me for the better. It was COVID
                    season since the day I joined, so it was all remote. IIIT-Delhi boasting itself to be a research-led
                    Institute, made me focus more on fundamental academic aspects rather than job-related aspects. I
                    started ambitiously on a project worthy of being published in a research conference that could be
                    done within the first semester, and reality hit at the end of the first semester. Then I slowly
                    started my research exploration through LCS2 in my second semester. I chose to do all - Thesis,
                    taking the full 20 credits in the second semester, studying Advanced Machine Learning, pursuing AI
                    specialization, taking an SSH course, try my hands on an online IS (NPTEL) course. IIIT-Delhi gave
                    me the scope for my limits, and I pushed them through, and I am happy for every inch of it. If, at
                    all, my hard choices may have led me not to excel grade-wise, I would have still been the most
                    content with my choices. Because what I learned through them is much more valuable. Last but not the
                    least are the bunch of my friends whom I met on campus in a short span of 2-3 months. They are the
                    sweetest, and my heart yearns to bond more with them. Thanks for the incredible time and support!

                    I would like to thank the committee that decided to relax the bachelor's degree (course) criteria
                    for admission to M.Tech. CSE. From scrambling to finding the institutes considering electrical
                    background as well for a Master's in CSE to securing a Gold medal for excellent academic
                    performance, IIIT-Delhi accepted me with open arms and transformed me for the better.
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    It was COVID season since the day I joined, so it was all remote. IIIT-Delhi boasting itself to be a
                    research-led Institute, made me focus more on fundamental academic aspects rather than job-related
                    aspects. I started ambitiously on a project worthy of being published in a research conference that
                    could be done within the first semester, and reality hit at the end of the first semester. Then I
                    slowly started my research exploration through LCS2 in my second semester. I chose to do all -
                    Thesis, taking the full 20 credits in the second semester, studying Advanced Machine Learning,
                    pursuing AI specialization, taking an SSH course, try my hands on an online IS (NPTEL) course.
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    IIIT-Delhi gave me the scope for my limits, and I pushed them through, and I am happy for every inch
                    of it. If, at all, my hard choices may have led me not to excel grade-wise, I would have still been
                    the most content with my choices. Because what I learned through them is much more valuable. Last

                    Five years at IIIT-Delhi was a great experience in all aspects. It was full of challenging tasks,
                    teaching assistant responsibilities, other curricular activities, and ups and downs. In addition,
                    tours, sports, gym, yoga, and walking around campus with friends and supervisors enriched my
                    experience.
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    The first year passed in finding supervisors and coursework. Picking up supervisors was the most
                    challenging task for me, but eventually, at the end of the first year, I got my first supervisor.
                    Finally, I signed with three supervisors during my Ph.D. journey. Beyond these, I started sports
                    activities and tours with friends; I played table tennis for the first time in my life, and it
                    became my favorite game.

                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    During the second year, I started participating in other curricular activities and learned teamwork
                    as a member of various committees. In addition, I got the enormous opportunity to be a secretary for
                    the Research Showcase, which led me to experience and learn a great combination of leadership and
                    teamwork. On the curricular end, I started to work in a new discipline (Computational Biology
                    without knowing B of Biology) and learned a lot. Finally, Data Science and Computational Biology
                    have become my primary areas of research interest. At the end of the second year, I presented an
                    article at the conference that was the first published article of my Ph.D. journey.
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    The third year was full of internships, workshops, research showcases, collaborations, and visiting
                    Professors'office. I also started learning to swim to overcome my water phobia, which was a great
                    experience with swimming trainers. As a result, I finally got to know various swimming styles.
                    Furthermore, until the end of the third year, I made multiple tours with friends, covering almost
                    half the states of India for the first time. Among these, Sikkim was the best experiencefor me, with
                    minus 10 degrees of temperature and climbing mountains with height phobia.
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    I gave my first invited talk and experienced teaching skills in the fourth year. Then the COVID-19
                    pandemic came, and I started to work from home. During this time, I got to start publishing the work
                    of my dissertation. Frequently meeting online enabled me to publish my first paperon covidwithin
                    four months of starting the project. Then came a day in September when I gave and passed my
                    comprehensive examination.

                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    My last year at IIIT-Delhi was full of writing my dissertation and papers. However, the most
                    beautiful experience during this year was getting a job at Harvard Medical school. I started
                    applying for a postdoc position in March and got an offer in the same month, which was beyond my
                    expectation. I accepted the postdoc offer, which led to me going out of India for the first time.
                    Finally, I defended my dissertation at the end of last year.
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    These experiences enhanced my knowledge, presentation skills, public speaking skills, teamworking
                    abilities, leadership, and fitness.

                    experiences, met incredible people, and made lifelong friends. Transitioning from a Wet Lab
                    (Biotechnology) to a Dry Lab (Computational Biology) was difficult. Still, with perseverance and a
                    never-say-die attitude, I completed my Ph.D., which would not have been possible without the help of
                    my friends, family, and many people at IIIT-Delhi. I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Mr.
                    Khushpinder Sharma and Dr. Amita Puri for their unwavering support, bringing me out of my
                    depression, dealing with my panic attacks, and patiently listening to me. They both made my journey
                    much easier and helped me regain my confidence. In the last five and a half years, I've evolved into
                    a confident unwavering optimist who believes there is no such thing as failure, only feedback. I am
                    looking forward to convocation day after years of hard work. I'd like to thank the entire IIIT-Delhi
                    family for their contributions and support over the years.

                    When I was in the classroom with 20-year-olds, I did raise the average age a bit. As a graduate
                    student, I never found the age gap challenging. My professors never treated me as anything but
                    another student, and the other students were also great to me. The toughest part for me was the
                    transition from a demanding corporate environment to a rigorous academic environment. I approached
                    the Ph.D. program as a learning process to challenge myself intellectually and emotionally. I have
                    pleasant memories garnered throughout my Ph.D. journey that will be cherished for the rest of my
                    life.

                    4 years at IIIT-Delhi!!! On one thought, it seems like a vast time, while on the other, it seems to
                    have passed very quickly.
                    From the first to the last day of college, I've had many experiences that have changed me in various
                    ways and molded me into my current version. One thing I'm grateful to the Institute is the world of
                    technology, knowledge, and opportunities it opened for me, which in turn gave me the confidence to

                    There are a whole lot of things that a person experiences during this phase of their life. Meeting
                    new people and being in a new environment gives you a different kind of exposure which helps you
                    learn about life. At times, it becomes overwhelming to be in such a competitive environment where
                    everyone is working so hard. Still, it's essential not to get bothered about all this and to believe
                    in yourself and focus on what matters to you. Everyone is unique in their way. Apart from academics,
                    it is also important to explore different things. Not just the academic and external side of yours,
                    but one may also learn how to manage themselves internally. And this is an essential life skill that
                    may also help you to go through not-so-great phases of life.

                    “What next?” was a terrifying question for me after graduating high school. It was time for me to
                    choose my career path and make a crucial life decision. While exploring courses to pursue my
                    undergrad, I came across the BTech in Computer Science and Social Science program offered at
                    IIIT-Delhi. Sure I had my inhibitions and fears, it wasn't a well-established program back then, and
                    there were no alumni to discuss the curriculum or career paths with. Despite all of this, the moment
                    I read about this course, I knew it was what I wanted to pursue!
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    I took the onus to make the best of this amazing opportunity and enrolled in the program. Looking
                    back, it was a risk I took, but it bore great results, and I am glad I took the leap of faith.
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    My four years at IIIT-Delhi were transformational in more than one way. Academically, I tried out a
                    variety of courses, took up research projects in different domains, worked under the guidance of
                    some exemplary professors, and was lucky to secure some amazing scholarships and internships. But
                    more importantly, I grew as a person. College life is where you are encouraged to make decisions,
                    make mistakes and learn from them. It is a time to explore not only your career goals but also
                    yourself! And that is something that I am always going to be grateful for.
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    The extracurricular activities in college made me a better leader. They taught me how to communicate
                    and manage my time better, think on my feet, make decisions on the go, and, most importantly, be
                    confident. I feel each of these skills is as important, if not more, than the knowledge I gained
                    from my courses and projects.
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    However, the one thing that I am most grateful to IIIT-Delhi for is the people I've met here. I made
                    bonds for a lifetime, be it my professors whom I still approach for advice or my friends who,
                    throughout the four years of my college life, pushed me to do better, appreciated me for my
                    achievements, and supported me in my low days.
                    <hr style="border: none;">
                    Thank you, IIITD, for all the memories; you will always be fondly remembered.
